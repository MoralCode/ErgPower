# ErgPower

This is the public repository documenting my attempt to replace the flywheel of a Concept2 Ergometer (AKA Indoor Rowing Machine) with a generator so the excess energy generated from rowing rowing can be used as a source of green power rather than being wasted by air resistance.

## Origin Story

This project came about as a means to fulfill a few different purposes:

  - To continue the legacy of [John X
    Linnehan](https://gainesvilleiguana.org/2020/articles/john-x-linnehan-from-priest-to-activist/),
    a Florida-based activist who fought for “peace, social justice, and
    environmental sustainability”
  - To add indoor rowing machines to the list of green energy-producing
    fitness equipment like the ones that are made by [The Green
    Microgym](https://www.thegreenmicrogym.com/)
  - To apply some of the the work done in a
    [paper](https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-043015-110538/unrestricted/MQP_FINAL.pdf)
    from Worcester Polytechnic Institute investigating the potential for
    power generation using a Concept2 Indoor Rowing Machine (Ergometer)
