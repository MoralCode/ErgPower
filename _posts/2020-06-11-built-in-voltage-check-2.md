# Experiment 2
wired two LED’s (through-hole 5mm pretty standard random green LED’s I had), each in a different direction between the tip and the ground of the 2.5mm audio jack

**Observations:**
	- model C did nothing visible. Possibly a confirmation of the super low (sub .15v) voltages seen from yesterdays tests.
	- Model D saw one of the LED’s (the one with the flat side/cathode wired to the tip of the jack) flash at a rate that seemed correlated with flywheel speed. 
	- Both LED’s were tested to work before and after using the 3.3v supply of an arduino uno
	- would be interesting to test to see if the other channel of the stereo output of the model D is similar
	- supposedly the model D+ ergs should be able to generate around 7V (unsubstantiated rumors from  crewmates)
		- What do they do with the extra energy since they normally(?) run on 2xAA batteries (3v)
